  abstract = {Quantum computers represent a transformative frontier in computational technology, promising exponential speedups beyond classical computing limits. IBM Quantum has led significant advancements in both hardware and software, providing access to quantum hardware via IBM Cloud{\textregistered} since 2016 and achieving a milestone with the world's first accessible quantum computer. This paper explores IBM's journey in quantum computing, focusing on its contributions to both hardware and software, as well as the development of practical quantum computers. We trace the evolution of IBM Quantum's processors, from the early canary processors to the milestone of surpassing the 1000-qubit barrier. In addition to these technological strides, we delve into the practical applications of quantum computing, particularly within nine key industries: airlines, banking, healthcare, electronics, life sciences, and more. We also explore IBM Quantum's case studies and strategic partnerships with organizations such as Boeing, CERN, ExxonMobil,~and Cleveland Clinic, which are helping to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications. Further, we examine the key challenges and solutions in scaling quantum systems and achieving fault tolerance, highlighting IBM's efforts toward building practical, fault-tolerant quantum systems capable of addressing real-world problems.},

  abstract = {Classical shadow tomography is a powerful randomized measurement protocol for predicting many properties of a quantum state with few measurements. Two classical shadow protocols have been extensively studied in the literature: the single-qubit (local) Pauli measurement, which is well suited for predicting local operators but inefficient for large operators; and the global Clifford measurement, which is efficient for low-rank operators but infeasible on near-term quantum devices due to the extensive gate overhead. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable classical shadow tomography approach for generic randomized measurements implemented with finite-depth local Clifford random unitary circuits, which interpolates between the limits of Pauli and Clifford measurements. The method combines the recently proposed locally-scrambled classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network techniques to achieve scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction map and evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample efficiency and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We show that the shallow-circuit measurement protocol provides immediate, exponential advantages over the Pauli measurement protocol for predicting quasi-local operators. It also enables a more efficient fidelity estimation compared to the Pauli measurement.},

  abstract = {Neural networks have achieved remarkable performance across various problem domains, but their widespread applicability is hindered by inherent limitations such as overconfidence in predictions, lack of interpretability, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive capabilities. This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the fundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating their synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience comprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but lacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep neural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an overview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior and performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations associated with training and inference in BNNs. Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research, acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable resource, it fosters an understanding of BNNs and their promising prospects, facilitating further advancements in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.},

  abstract = {Quantum metrology promises unprecedented measurement precision but suffers in practice from the limited availability of resources such as the number of probes, their coherence time, or nonclassical quantum states. The adaptive Bayesian approach to parameter estimation allows an efficient use of resources because of adaptive experiment design. For its practical success, fast numerical solutions for the Bayesian update and the adaptive experiment design are crucial. Here we show that neural networks can be trained to become fast and strong experiment-design heuristics using a combination of an evolutionary strategy and reinforcement learning. Neural-network heuristics are shown to outperform established heuristics for the technologically important example of frequency estimation of a qubit that suffers from dephasing. Our method of creating neural-network heuristics is very general and complements the well-studied sequential Monte Carlo method for Bayesian updates to form a complete framework for adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation.},

Traditional sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design approaches require substantial computation at each stage of the experiment. This makes them unsuitable for most real-world applications, where decisions must typically be made quickly. DAD addresses this restriction by learning an amortized design network upfront and then using this to rapidly run (multiple) adaptive experiments at deployment time. This network represents a design policy which takes as input the data from previous steps, and outputs the next design using a single forward pass; these design decisions can be made in milliseconds during the live experiment. To train the network, we introduce contrastive information bounds that are suitable objectives for the sequential setting, and propose a customized network architecture that exploits key symmetries. We demonstrate that DAD successfully amortizes the process of experimental design, outperforming alternative strategies on a number of problems.},

  abstract = {Photonic integrated circuits offer a compact and stable platform for generating, manipulating, and detecting light. They are instrumental for classical and quantum applications. Imperfections stemming from fabrication constraints, tolerances, and operation wavelength impose limitations on the accuracy and thus utility of current photonic integrated devices. Mitigating these imperfections typically necessitates a model of the underlying physical structure and the estimation of parameters that are challenging to access. Direct solutions are currently lacking for mesh configurations extending beyond trivial cases. We introduce a scalable and innovative method to characterize photonic chips through an iterative machine learning-assisted procedure. Our method is based on a clear-box approach that harnesses a fully modeled virtual replica of the photonic chip to characterize. The process is sample-efficient and can be carried out with a continuous-wave laser and powermeters. The model estimates individual passive phases, crosstalk, beamsplitter reflectivity values, and relative input/output losses. Building upon the accurate characterization results, we mitigate imperfections to enable enhanced control over the device. We validate our characterization and imperfection mitigation methods on a 12-mode Clements-interferometer equipped with 126 phase shifters, achieving beyond state-of-the-art chip control with an average 99.77\% amplitude fidelity on 100 implemented Haar-random unitary matrices.},

In addition, gates acting on different sets of qubits require unique sets of control parameters. Thus, an efficient multidimensional parameter estimation procedure is crucial to calibrate even medium-sized quantum processors. Here, we develop and characterize an efficient calibration protocol to automatically estimate and adjust experimental parameters of the widely used two-qubit M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen entangling gate operation in a trapped-ion quantum information processor. The protocol exploits Bayesian parameter estimation methods that include a stopping criterion based on a desired gate infidelity. We experimentally demonstrate a tune-up procedure that leads to a residual median gate infidelity due to miscalibration of 1.3⁢(1) {\texttimes}10-3, requiring 1200 {\textpm}500 experimental cycles, while completing the entire gate calibration procedure in less than one minute, which provides a significant speedup over commonly used manual tune-up routines. This approach is applicable to other quantum information processor architectures with known or sufficiently characterized theoretical models.},

These control pulses provide the fundamental interface between the quantum compiler and the quantum hardware. Most current software for quantum optimal control (e.g. Qutip or Krotov) is restricted to run on shared memory platforms, limiting their applicability to smaller quantum systems, in particular if interactions with the environment are taken into account. This paper gives an overview of the open-source code Quandary, which is designed to solve quantum control problems in larger open quantum systems modelled by Lindblad's master equation. Implemented in C++, Quandary uses the message passing paradigm for distributed memory computers that enables scalability to large numbers of compute cores. Accompanied by numerical examples, this paper presents an overview on existing theoretical developments for open optimal quantum control realizing state-to-state transfer, unitary gate optimization as well as state-preparation, and presents the numerical tools and implementation aspect as realized in Quandary, for deployment on modern high-performance computing platforms.},

Techniques from classical estimation and dynamic control, suitably adapted to the strictures of quantum measurement, provide an opportunity to extract augmented hardware performance through automation of low-level characterization and control. In this work, we present an adaptive learning framework, Noise Mapping for Quantum Architectures (NMQA), for scheduling of sensor--qubit measurements and efficient spatial noise mapping (prior to actuation) across device architectures. Via a two-layer particle filter, NMQA receives binary measurements and determines regions within the architecture that share common noise processes; an adaptive controller then schedules future measurements to reduce map uncertainty. Numerical analysis and experiments on an array of trapped ytterbium ions demonstrate that NMQA outperforms brute-force mapping by up to 20{\texttimes} (3{\texttimes}) in simulations (experiments), calculated as a reduction in the number of measurements required to map a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field with a target error metric. As an early adaptation of robotic control to quantum devices, this work opens up exciting new avenues in quantum computer science.},

QCVV methods and protocols enable scientists and engineers to scrutinize, understand, and enhance the performance of quantum information-processing devices. In this tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers. We define and explain QCVV's core models and concepts---quantum states, measurements, and processes---and illustrate how these building blocks are leveraged to examine a target system or operation. We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers.

However, conventional techniques for noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require measurements of the noise spectral density at many different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative approach to noise spectroscopy, which requires fewer resources, and relies on direct measurement of arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectral density. This method uses random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations, which are chosen using algorithms for phase retrieval. These measurements allow us to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.},

In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic.

  abstract = {Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new methods to suppress the {$e$}⁢{$f$} transition of a transmon qubit with an anharmonicity of -212 MHz, we implement {$RX$}⁢({$\pi$}/2) gates achieving a leakage error below 3.0 {\texttimes}10-5 down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns without the need for iterative closed-loop optimization. The obtained leakage error represents a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional cosine DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per gate of (1.56 {\textpm}0.07) {\texttimes}10-4 at a 7.9-ns gate duration, outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed. Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of temporal microwave control-pulse distortions, and demonstrate that non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using predistortion.},

  abstract = {We introduce implicit Deep Adaptive Design (iDAD), a new method for performing adaptive experiments in real-time with implicit models. iDAD amortizes the cost of Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) by learning a design policy network upfront, which can then be deployed quickly at the time of the experiment. The iDAD network can be trained on any model which simulates differentiable samples, unlike previous design policy work that requires a closed form likelihood and conditionally independent experiments. At deployment, iDAD allows design decisions to be made in milliseconds, in contrast to traditional BOED approaches that require heavy computation during the experiment itself. We illustrate the applicability of iDAD on a number of experiments, and show that it provides a fast and effective mechanism for performing adaptive design with implicit models.},

As the number of devices on chip increases, this task becomes ever more time-consuming, and will be intractable on a large scale without efficient automation. We present measurements on a quantum dot device performed by a machine learning algorithm in real time. The algorithm selects the most informative measurements to perform next by combining information theory with a probabilistic deep-generative model that can generate full-resolution reconstructions from scattered partial measurements. We demonstrate, for two different current map configurations that the algorithm outperforms standard grid scan techniques, reducing the number of measurements required by up to 4 times and the measurement time by 3.7 times. Our contribution goes beyond the use of machine learning for data search and analysis, and instead demonstrates the use of algorithms to automate measurements. This works lays the foundation for learning-based automated measurement of quantum devices.},

We formulate flexible transport-based schemes for EIG estimation in general nonlinear/non-Gaussian settings, compatible with both standard and implicit Bayesian models. These schemes are representative of two-stage methods for estimating or bounding EIG using marginal and conditional density estimates. In this setting, we analyze the optimal allocation of samples between training (density estimation) and approximation of the outer prior expectation. We show that with this optimal sample allocation, the MSE of the resulting EIG estimator converges more quickly than that of a standard nested Monte Carlo scheme. We then address the estimation of EIG in high dimensions, by deriving gradient-based upper bounds on the mutual information lost by projecting the parameters and/or observations to lower-dimensional subspaces. Minimizing these upper bounds yields projectors and hence low-dimensional EIG approximations that outperform approximations obtained via other linear dimension reduction schemes. Numerical experiments on a PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problem also illustrate a favorable trade-off between dimension truncation and the modeling of non-Gaussianity, when estimating EIG from finite samples in high dimensions.},

Parameters will drift in time and experiments interleave protocols that perform parameter estimation, with protocols that measure the dynamics of interest. Here we specialize to a system made of qubits where the dynamics correspond to a quantum computation. We propose setting aside some qubits, which we call spectator qubits, to be measured periodically during the computation, to act as probes of the changing experimental and environmental parameters. By using control strategies that minimize the sensitivity of the qubits involved in the computation, we can acquire sufficient information from the spectator qubits to update our estimates of the parameters and improve our control. As a result, we can increase the length of experiments where the dynamics of the data qubits are highly reliable. In particular, we simulate how spectator qubits can keep the error level of operations on data qubits below a 10               -4               threshold in two scenarios involving coherent errors: a classical magnetic field gradient dynamically decoupled with sequences of two or four               {$\pi$}               -pulses, and laser beam instability detected via crosstalk with neighboring atoms in an ion trap.},

SMC allows for probabilistic evaluation of properties of interest, such as a certain parameter's time to failure. We extend the SMC for Processor Analysis (SPA) framework, which uses SMC for evaluation of classical systems, to create SPA for Quantum calibration (SPAQ) enabling simplified tuning and analysis of quantum system calibration. We focus on a directed acyclic graph-based calibration optimization scheme and demonstrate how to craft properties of interest for its analysis.

In these cases, simple qubit control fails on short time scales because of coupling to leakage levels. We provide an easy to implement analytic formula that inhibits this leakage from any single-control analog or pixelated pulse. It is based on adding a second control that is proportional to the time derivative of the first. For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art, all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes. These results show that even weak anharmonicity is sufficient and in general not a limiting factor for implementing quantum gates.},

It offers many advantages in automating decision processes to navigate large parameter spaces. This paper proposes an approach to the efficient measurement of quantum devices based on deep reinforcement learning. We focus on double quantum dot devices, demonstrating the fully automatic identification of specific transport features called bias triangles. Measurements targeting these features are difficult to automate, since bias triangles are found in otherwise featureless regions of the parameter space. Our algorithm identifies bias triangles in a mean time of {$<$}30\,min, and sometimes as little as 1\,min. This approach, based on dueling deep Q-networks, can be adapted to a broad range of devices and target transport features. This is a crucial demonstration of the utility of deep reinforcement learning for decision making in the measurement and operation of quantum devices.},

  abstract = {Gate set tomography (GST) is a protocol for detailed, predictive characterization of logic operations (gates) on quantum computing processors. Early versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been refined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper presents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important feature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is that it is                                                   calibration-free                                               . GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state preparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in a                                                   gate set                                               simultaneously and self-consistently, relative to each other. Long sequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency, achieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper, we cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to achieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error bars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets. Our focus is fundamental mathematical aspects of GST, rather than implementation details, but we touch on some of the foundational algorithmic tricks used in the                                                   pyGSTi                                               implementation.},

However, the Jensen--Shannon divergence between Gaussian distributions is not available in closed form. To bypass this problem, we present a generalization of the Jensen--Shannon (JS) divergence using abstract means which yields closed-form expressions when the mean is chosen according to the parametric family of distributions. More generally, we define the JS-symmetrizations of any distance using parameter mixtures derived from abstract means. In particular, we first show that the geometric mean is well-suited for exponential families, and report two closed-form formula for (i) the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence between probability densities of the same exponential family; and (ii) the geometric JS-symmetrization of the reverse Kullback--Leibler divergence between probability densities of the same exponential family. As a second illustrating example, we show that the harmonic mean is well-suited for the scale Cauchy distributions, and report a closed-form formula for the harmonic Jensen--Shannon divergence between scale Cauchy distributions. Applications to clustering with respect to these novel Jensen--Shannon divergences are touched upon.},

They harness non-local regularities of noisy control trajectories and facilitate transfer learning between tasks. To leverage these powerful capabilities for quantum control optimization, we propose a new control framework to simultaneously optimize the speed and fidelity of quantum computation against both leakage and stochastic control errors. For a broad family of two-qubit unitary gates that are important for quantum simulation of many-electron systems, we improve the control robustness by adding control noise into training environments for reinforcement learning agents trained with trusted-region-policy-optimization. The agent control solutions demonstrate a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in average-gate-error over baseline stochastic-gradient-descent solutions and up to a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in gate time from optimal gate synthesis counterparts. These significant improvements in both fidelity and runtime are achieved by combining new physical understandings and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Our results open a venue for wider applications in quantum simulation, quantum chemistry and quantum supremacy tests using near-term quantum devices.},

Our recursive two-step lookahead acquisition function for Bayesian optimization makes nonmyopic decisions at every stage by maximizing the expected utility at the specified time horizon. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step lookahead framework with a customizable {\textbackslash}emph\{value\} function that allows users to define the utility. We illustrate how lookahead versions of classic acquisition functions such as the expected improvement, probability of improvement, and upper confidence bound can be obtained with this framework.

Although these high numbers engender optimism that fault-tolerant quantum computing is within reach, the connection of average gate fidelity with fault-tolerance requirements is not direct. Here we use reported average gate fidelity to determine an upper bound on the quantum-gate error rate, which is the appropriate metric for assessing progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation, and we demonstrate that this bound is asymptotically tight for general noise. Although this bound is unlikely to be saturated by experimental noise, we demonstrate using explicit examples that the bound indicates a realistic deviation between the true error rate and the reported average fidelity. We introduce the Pauli distance as a measure of this deviation, and we show that knowledge of the Pauli distance enables tighter estimates of the error rate of quantum gates.},

In this paper, we show how this approach holds promise for adaptive measurement strategies to characterize present-day quantum technology platforms. In particular, we focus on arrays of coupled cavities and qubit arrays. Both represent model systems of high relevance for modern applications, like quantum simulations and computing, and both have been realized in platforms where measurement and control can be exploited to characterize and counteract unavoidable disorder. Thus, they represent ideal targets for applications of Bayesian experimental design.},

Here we present a closed-loop Bayesian learning algorithm for estimating multiple unknown parameters in a dynamical model, using optimized experimental ``probe'' controls and measurement. The estimation algorithm is based on a Bayesian particle filter, and is designed to autonomously choose informationally optimized probe experiments with which to compare to model predictions. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in both simulated calibration tasks and in an experimental single-qubit ion-trap system. Experimentally, we find that, with 60 times fewer samples, we exceed the precision of conventional calibration methods, delivering an approximately 93 times improvement in efficiency (as quantified by the reduction of measurements and resets required to achieve a target residual uncertainty and multiplied by the increase in accuracy). In simulated and experimental demonstrations, we see that successively longer pulses are selected as the posterior uncertainty iteratively decreases, leading to an exponential improvement in the accuracy of model parameters with the number of experimental queries, and a commensurate increase in the per-query time.},

Second, we show that a fundamental leap of capacity emerges when the depth of affine flows exceeds 3 transformation layers. Third, we prove the non-universality of the affine normalizing flow, regardless of its depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The ability to use quantum technology to achieve useful tasks, be they scientific or industry related, boils down to precise quantum control. In general it is difficult to assess a proposed solution due to the difficulties in characterizing the quantum system or device. These arise because of the impossibility to characterize certain components in situ, and are exacerbated by noise induced by the environment and active controls. Here, we present a general purpose characterization and control solution making use of a deep learning framework composed of quantum features. We provide the framework, sample datasets, trained models, and their performance metrics. In addition, we demonstrate how the trained model can be used to extract conventional indicators, such as noise power spectra.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Understanding and controlling engineered quantum systems is key to developing practical quantum technology. However, given the current technological limitations, such as fabrication imperfections and environmental noise, this is not always possible. To address these issues, a great deal of theoretical and numerical methods for quantum system identification and control have been developed. These methods range from traditional curve fittings, which are limited by the accuracy of the model that describes the system, to machine learning (ML) methods, which provide efficient control solutions but no control beyond the output of the model, nor insights into the underlying physical process. Here we experimentally demonstrate a `graybox' approach to construct a physical model of a quantum system and use it to design optimal control. We report superior performance over model fitting, while generating unitaries and Hamiltonians, which are quantities not available from the structure of standard supervised ML models. Our approach combines physics principles with high-accuracy ML and is effective with any problem where the required controlled quantities cannot be directly measured in experiments. This method naturally extends to time-dependent and open quantum systems, with applications in quantum noise spectroscopy and cancellation.},

  abstract = {The complexity of experimental quantum information processing devices is increasing rapidly, requiring new approaches to control them. In this paper, we address the problems of practically modeling and controlling an integrated optical waveguide array chip---a technology expected to have many applications in telecommunications and optical quantum information processing. This photonic circuit can be electrically reconfigured, but only the output optical signal can be monitored. As a result, the conventional control methods cannot be naively applied. Characterizing such a chip is challenging for three reasons. First, there are uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonian model describing the chip. Second, we expect distortions of the control voltages caused by the chip's electrical response, which cannot be directly observed. And third, there are imperfections in the measurements caused by losses from coupling the chip externally to optical fibers. We have developed a deep neural network (NN) approach to solve these problems. The architecture is designed specifically to overcome the aforementioned challenges using a gated recurrent unit -based network as the central component. The Hamiltonian is estimated as a blackbox, while the rules of quantum mechanics such as state evolution is embedded in the structure as a whitebox. The resulting overall graybox model of the chip shows good performance both quantitatively in terms of the mean square error and qualitatively in terms of the shape of the predicted waveforms We use this NN to solve a classical and a quantum control problem. In the classical application we find a control sequence to approximately realize a time-dependent output power distribution. For the quantum application we obtain the control voltages to realize a target set of quantum gates. The method we propose is generic and can be applied to other systems that can only be probed indirectly.},

A graybox model that is empirically obtained from measurement data is employed to approximately represent the unknown quantum noise. The estimated model is then used to calculate the open-loop control pulses under constraints on the pulse amplitude and timing. For the control pulse optimization, we explore the use of gradient descent and genetic optimization methods. We consider the effect of finite sampling on estimating expectation values of observables and show results for single- and multi-axis control of a qubit.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Reinforcement learning has been widely used in many problems, including quantum control of qubits. However, such problems can, at the same time, be solved by traditional, non-machine-learning methods, such as stochastic gradient descent and Krotov algorithms, and it remains unclear which one is most suitable when the control has specific constraints. In this work, we perform a comparative study on the efficacy of three reinforcement learning algorithms: tabular Q-learning, deep Q-learning, and policy gradient, as well as two non-machine-learning methods: stochastic gradient descent and Krotov algorithms, in the problem of preparing a desired quantum state. We found that overall, the deep Q-learning and policy gradient algorithms outperform others when the problem is discretized, e.g. allowing discrete values of control, and when the problem scales up. The reinforcement learning algorithms can also adaptively reduce the complexity of the control sequences, shortening the operation time and improving the fidelity. Our comparison provides insights into the suitability of reinforcement learning in quantum control problems.},
