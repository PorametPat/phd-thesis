IBM Quantum has led significant advancements in both hardware and software, providing access to quantum hardware via IBM Cloud{\textregistered} since 2016 and achieving a milestone with the world's first accessible quantum computer. This paper explores IBM's journey in quantum computing, focusing on its contributions to both hardware and software, as well as the development of practical quantum computers. We trace the evolution of IBM Quantum's processors, from the early canary processors to the milestone of surpassing the 1000-qubit barrier. In addition to these technological strides, we delve into the practical applications of quantum computing, particularly within nine key industries: airlines, banking, healthcare, electronics, life sciences, and more. We also explore IBM Quantum's case studies and strategic partnerships with organizations such as Boeing, CERN, ExxonMobil,~and Cleveland Clinic, which are helping to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications. Further, we examine the key challenges and solutions in scaling quantum systems and achieving fault tolerance, highlighting IBM's efforts toward building practical, fault-tolerant quantum systems capable of addressing real-world problems.},

  abstract = {Classical shadow tomography is a powerful randomized measurement protocol for predicting many properties of a quantum state with few measurements. Two classical shadow protocols have been extensively studied in the literature: the single-qubit (local) Pauli measurement, which is well suited for predicting local operators but inefficient for large operators; and the global Clifford measurement, which is efficient for low-rank operators but infeasible on near-term quantum devices due to the extensive gate overhead. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable classical shadow tomography approach for generic randomized measurements implemented with finite-depth local Clifford random unitary circuits, which interpolates between the limits of Pauli and Clifford measurements. The method combines the recently proposed locally-scrambled classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network techniques to achieve scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction map and evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample efficiency and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We show that the shallow-circuit measurement protocol provides immediate, exponential advantages over the Pauli measurement protocol for predicting quasi-local operators. It also enables a more efficient fidelity estimation compared to the Pauli measurement.},

This tutorial paper introduces the basic elements of this theory based on the Pontryagin maximum principle, in a physicist-friendly way. An analogy with classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is proposed to present the main results used in this field. Emphasis is placed on the different numerical algorithms to solve a QOC problem. Several examples ranging from the control of two-level quantum systems to that of Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs) in a one-dimensional optical lattice are studied in detail, using both analytical and numerical methods. Codes based on shooting method and gradient-based algorithms are provided. The connection between optimal processes and the quantum speed limit is also discussed in two-level quantum systems. In the case of BEC, the experimental implementation of optimal control protocols is described, both for two-level and many-level cases, with the current constraints and limitations of such platforms. This presentation is illustrated by the corresponding experimental results.},

  abstract = {Neural networks have achieved remarkable performance across various problem domains, but their widespread applicability is hindered by inherent limitations such as overconfidence in predictions, lack of interpretability, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive capabilities. This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the fundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating their synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience comprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but lacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep neural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an overview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior and performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations associated with training and inference in BNNs. Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research, acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable resource, it fosters an understanding of BNNs and their promising prospects, facilitating further advancements in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.},

We demonstrate single-qubit control, implementing a universal gate set as well as a random gate set, achieving high fidelity under unknown, strongly-coupled non-Markovian non-Gaussian noise, significantly outperforming traditional methods.

  abstract = {The accumulation of physical errors1--3 prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm5. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes6. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7\%~for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code7--10 that for 20\,years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with~CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1~million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1\%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000~physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.},

Here we demonstrate high-fidelity parity detection of two code qubits via measurement of a third syndrome qubit. With high-fidelity gates, we generate entanglement distributed across three superconducting qubits in a lattice where each code qubit is coupled to two bus resonators. Via high-fidelity measurement of the syndrome qubit, we deterministically entangle the code qubits in either an even or odd parity Bell state, conditioned on the syndrome qubit state. Finally, to fully characterize this parity readout, we develop a measurement tomography protocol. The lattice presented naturally extends to larger networks of qubits, outlining a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

The adaptive Bayesian approach to parameter estimation allows an efficient use of resources because of adaptive experiment design. For its practical success, fast numerical solutions for the Bayesian update and the adaptive experiment design are crucial. Here we show that neural networks can be trained to become fast and strong experiment-design heuristics using a combination of an evolutionary strategy and reinforcement learning. Neural-network heuristics are shown to outperform established heuristics for the technologically important example of frequency estimation of a qubit that suffers from dephasing. Our method of creating neural-network heuristics is very general and complements the well-studied sequential Monte Carlo method for Bayesian updates to form a complete framework for adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation.},

  abstract = {MC Dropout is a mainstream "free lunch" method in medical imaging for approximate Bayesian computations (ABC). Its appeal is to solve out-of-the-box the daunting task of ABC and uncertainty quantification in Neural Networks (NNs); to fall within the variational inference (VI) framework; and to propose a highly multimodal, faithful predictive posterior. We question the properties of MC Dropout for approximate inference, as in fact MC Dropout changes the Bayesian model; its predictive posterior assigns \$0\$ probability to the true model on closed-form benchmarks; the multimodality of its predictive posterior is not a property of the true predictive posterior but a design artefact. To address the need for VI on arbitrary models, we share a generic VI engine within the pytorch framework. The code includes a carefully designed implementation of structured (diagonal plus low-rank) multivariate normal variational families, and mixtures thereof. It is intended as a go-to no-free-lunch approach, addressing shortcomings of mean-field VI with an adjustable trade-off between expressivity and computational complexity.},

Traditional sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design approaches require substantial computation at each stage of the experiment. This makes them unsuitable for most real-world applications, where decisions must typically be made quickly. DAD addresses this restriction by learning an amortized design network upfront and then using this to rapidly run (multiple) adaptive experiments at deployment time. This network represents a design policy which takes as input the data from previous steps, and outputs the next design using a single forward pass; these design decisions can be made in milliseconds during the live experiment. To train the network, we introduce contrastive information bounds that are suitable objectives for the sequential setting, and propose a customized network architecture that exploits key symmetries. We demonstrate that DAD successfully amortizes the process of experimental design, outperforming alternative strategies on a number of problems.},

Imperfections stemming from fabrication constraints, tolerances, and operation wavelength impose limitations on the accuracy and thus utility of current photonic integrated devices. Mitigating these imperfections typically necessitates a model of the underlying physical structure and the estimation of parameters that are challenging to access. Direct solutions are currently lacking for mesh configurations extending beyond trivial cases. We introduce a scalable and innovative method to characterize photonic chips through an iterative machine learning-assisted procedure. Our method is based on a clear-box approach that harnesses a fully modeled virtual replica of the photonic chip to characterize. The process is sample-efficient and can be carried out with a continuous-wave laser and powermeters. The model estimates individual passive phases, crosstalk, beamsplitter reflectivity values, and relative input/output losses. Building upon the accurate characterization results, we mitigate imperfections to enable enhanced control over the device. We validate our characterization and imperfection mitigation methods on a 12-mode Clements-interferometer equipped with 126 phase shifters, achieving beyond state-of-the-art chip control with an average 99.77\% amplitude fidelity on 100 implemented Haar-random unitary matrices.},

Here, we propose an experimentally simple approach to realize optimal quantum controls tailored to the device parameters and environment while specifically characterizing this quantum system. Concretely, we use physics-inspired machine learning to infer an accurate model of the dynamics from experimentally available data and then optimize our experimental controls on this trained model. We show the power and feasibility of this approach by optimizing arbitrary single-qubit operations on a superconducting transmon qubit, using detailed numerical simulations. We demonstrate that this framework produces an accurate description of the device dynamics under arbitrary controls, together with the precise pulses achieving arbitrary single-qubit gates with a high fidelity of about 99.99\%.},

In addition, gates acting on different sets of qubits require unique sets of control parameters. Thus, an efficient multidimensional parameter estimation procedure is crucial to calibrate even medium-sized quantum processors. Here, we develop and characterize an efficient calibration protocol to automatically estimate and adjust experimental parameters of the widely used two-qubit M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen entangling gate operation in a trapped-ion quantum information processor. The protocol exploits Bayesian parameter estimation methods that include a stopping criterion based on a desired gate infidelity. We experimentally demonstrate a tune-up procedure that leads to a residual median gate infidelity due to miscalibration of 1.3⁢(1) {\texttimes}10-3, requiring 1200 {\textpm}500 experimental cycles, while completing the entire gate calibration procedure in less than one minute, which provides a significant speedup over commonly used manual tune-up routines. This approach is applicable to other quantum information processor architectures with known or sufficiently characterized theoretical models.},

  abstract = {New quantum computing architectures consider integrating qubits as sensors to provide actionable information useful for calibration or decoherence mitigation on neighboring data qubits, but little work has addressed how such schemes may be efficiently implemented in order to maximize information utilization. Techniques from classical estimation and dynamic control, suitably adapted to the strictures of quantum measurement, provide an opportunity to extract augmented hardware performance through automation of low-level characterization and control. In this work, we present an adaptive learning framework, Noise Mapping for Quantum Architectures (NMQA), for scheduling of sensor--qubit measurements and efficient spatial noise mapping (prior to actuation) across device architectures. Via a two-layer particle filter, NMQA receives binary measurements and determines regions within the architecture that share common noise processes; an adaptive controller then schedules future measurements to reduce map uncertainty. Numerical analysis and experiments on an array of trapped ytterbium ions demonstrate that NMQA outperforms brute-force mapping by up to 20{\texttimes} (3{\texttimes}) in simulations (experiments), calculated as a reduction in the number of measurements required to map a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field with a target error metric. As an early adaptation of robotic control to quantum devices, this work opens up exciting new avenues in quantum computer science.},

  abstract = {Qubit noise spectroscopy is an important tool for the experimental investigation of open quantum systems. However, conventional techniques for noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require measurements of the noise spectral density at many different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative approach to noise spectroscopy, which requires fewer resources, and relies on direct measurement of arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectral density. This method uses random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations, which are chosen using algorithms for phase retrieval. These measurements allow us to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.},

In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of attempts so far at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.},

  abstract = {Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new methods to suppress the {$e$}⁢{$f$} transition of a transmon qubit with an anharmonicity of -212 MHz, we implement {$RX$}⁢({$\pi$}/2) gates achieving a leakage error below 3.0 {\texttimes}10-5 down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns without the need for iterative closed-loop optimization. The obtained leakage error represents a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional cosine DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per gate of (1.56 {\textpm}0.07) {\texttimes}10-4 at a 7.9-ns gate duration, outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed. Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of temporal microwave control-pulse distortions, and demonstrate that non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using predistortion.},

The iDAD network can be trained on any model which simulates differentiable samples, unlike previous design policy work that requires a closed form likelihood and conditionally independent experiments. At deployment, iDAD allows design decisions to be made in milliseconds, in contrast to traditional BOED approaches that require heavy computation during the experiment itself. We illustrate the applicability of iDAD on a number of experiments, and show that it provides a fast and effective mechanism for performing adaptive design with implicit models.},

  abstract = {Measuring expectation values of observables is an essential ingredient in variational quantum algorithms. A practical obstacle is the necessity of a large number of measurements for statistical convergence to meet requirements of precision, such as chemical accuracy in the application to quantum chemistry computations. Here we propose an algorithm to estimate the expectation value based on its approximate expression as a weighted sum of classically tractable matrix elements with some modulation, where the weight and modulation factors are evaluated by sampling appropriately prepared quantum states in the computational basis on quantum computers. Each of those states is prepared by applying a unitary transformation consisting of at most {$N$} CNOT gates, where {$N$} is the number of qubits, to a target quantum state whose expectation value is evaluated. Our algorithm is expected to require fewer measurements than conventional methods for a required statistical precision of the expectation value when the target quantum state is concentrated in particular computational basis states. We provide numerical comparisons of our method with existing ones for measuring electronic ground-state energies (expectation values of electronic Hamiltonians for the lowest-energy states) of various small molecules. Numerical results show that our method can reduce the numbers of measurements to obtain the ground-state energies for a targeted precision by several orders of magnitudes for molecules whose ground states are concentrated. Our results provide another route to measure expectation values of observables, which could accelerate the variational quantum algorithms.},

As the number of devices on chip increases, this task becomes ever more time-consuming, and will be intractable on a large scale without efficient automation. We present measurements on a quantum dot device performed by a machine learning algorithm in real time. The algorithm selects the most informative measurements to perform next by combining information theory with a probabilistic deep-generative model that can generate full-resolution reconstructions from scattered partial measurements. We demonstrate, for two different current map configurations that the algorithm outperforms standard grid scan techniques, reducing the number of measurements required by up to 4 times and the measurement time by 3.7 times. Our contribution goes beyond the use of machine learning for data search and analysis, and instead demonstrates the use of algorithms to automate measurements. This works lays the foundation for learning-based automated measurement of quantum devices.},

  abstract = {Computing expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior (equivalently, mutual information between candidate observations and model parameters or other quantities of interest) is a fundamental challenge in Bayesian optimal experimental design. We formulate flexible transport-based schemes for EIG estimation in general nonlinear/non-Gaussian settings, compatible with both standard and implicit Bayesian models. These schemes are representative of two-stage methods for estimating or bounding EIG using marginal and conditional density estimates. In this setting, we analyze the optimal allocation of samples between training (density estimation) and approximation of the outer prior expectation. We show that with this optimal sample allocation, the MSE of the resulting EIG estimator converges more quickly than that of a standard nested Monte Carlo scheme. We then address the estimation of EIG in high dimensions, by deriving gradient-based upper bounds on the mutual information lost by projecting the parameters and/or observations to lower-dimensional subspaces. Minimizing these upper bounds yields projectors and hence low-dimensional EIG approximations that outperform approximations obtained via other linear dimension reduction schemes. Numerical experiments on a PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problem also illustrate a favorable trade-off between dimension truncation and the modeling of non-Gaussianity, when estimating EIG from finite samples in high dimensions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Accurate control of quantum systems requires a precise measurement of the parameters that govern the dynamics, including control fields and interactions with the environment. Parameters will drift in time and experiments interleave protocols that perform parameter estimation, with protocols that measure the dynamics of interest. Here we specialize to a system made of qubits where the dynamics correspond to a quantum computation. We propose setting aside some qubits, which we call spectator qubits, to be measured periodically during the computation, to act as probes of the changing experimental and environmental parameters. By using control strategies that minimize the sensitivity of the qubits involved in the computation, we can acquire sufficient information from the spectator qubits to update our estimates of the parameters and improve our control. As a result, we can increase the length of experiments where the dynamics of the data qubits are highly reliable. In particular, we simulate how spectator qubits can keep the error level of operations on data qubits below a 10               -4               threshold in two scenarios involving coherent errors: a classical magnetic field gradient dynamically decoupled with sequences of two or four               {$\pi$}               -pulses, and laser beam instability detected via crosstalk with neighboring atoms in an ion trap.},

However, realistic conditions such as non-Markovian noise, non-ideal pulses, and beyond rotating wave approximation (RWA) dynamics, pose significant challenges for controlling and characterizing qudits. In this work, we present a machine-learning-based graybox framework for the control and noise characterization of qudits with arbitrary dimension, extending recent methods developed for single-qubit systems. Additionally, we introduce a local analytic expansion that enables interpretable modelling of the noise dynamics, providing a structured and efficient way to simulate system behaviour and compare different noise models. This interpretability feature allows us to to understand the mechanisms underlying successful control strategies; and opens the way for developing methods for distinguishing noise sources with similar effects. We demonstrate high-fidelity implementations of both global unitary operations as well as two-level subspace gates. Our work establishes a foundation for scalable and interpretable quantum control techniques applicable to both NISQ devices and finite-dimensional quantum systems, enhancing the performance of next-generation quantum technologies.},

The phase of these drives can be used to generate zero-duration arbitrary virtual {$Z$} gates, which, combined with two {$X\pi$}/2 gates, can generate any SU(2) gate. Here we show how to best utilize these virtual {$Z$} gates to both improve algorithms and correct pulse errors. We perform randomized benchmarking using a Clifford set of Hadamard and {$Z$} gates and show that the error per Clifford is reduced versus a set consisting of standard finite-duration {$X$} and {$Y$} gates. {$Z$} gates can correct unitary rotation errors for weakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse-shaping techniques such as derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG). We investigate leakage and show that a combination of DRAG pulse shaping to minimize leakage and {$Z$} gates to correct rotation errors realizes a 13.3 ns {$X\pi$}/2 gate characterized by low error [1.95⁢(3){\texttimes}10-4] and low leakage [3.1⁢(6){\texttimes}10-6]. Ultimately leakage is limited by the finite temperature of the qubit, but this limit is two orders of magnitude smaller than pulse errors due to decoherence.},

In these cases, simple qubit control fails on short time scales because of coupling to leakage levels. We provide an easy to implement analytic formula that inhibits this leakage from any single-control analog or pixelated pulse. It is based on adding a second control that is proportional to the time derivative of the first. For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art, all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes. These results show that even weak anharmonicity is sufficient and in general not a limiting factor for implementing quantum gates.},

  abstract = {Gate set tomography (GST) is a protocol for detailed, predictive characterization of logic operations (gates) on quantum computing processors. Early versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been refined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper presents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important feature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is that it is                                                   calibration-free                                               . GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state preparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in a                                                   gate set                                               simultaneously and self-consistently, relative to each other. Long sequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency, achieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper, we cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to achieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error bars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets. Our focus is fundamental mathematical aspects of GST, rather than implementation details, but we touch on some of the foundational algorithmic tricks used in the                                                   pyGSTi                                               implementation.},

To leverage these powerful capabilities for quantum control optimization, we propose a new control framework to simultaneously optimize the speed and fidelity of quantum computation against both leakage and stochastic control errors. For a broad family of two-qubit unitary gates that are important for quantum simulation of many-electron systems, we improve the control robustness by adding control noise into training environments for reinforcement learning agents trained with trusted-region-policy-optimization. The agent control solutions demonstrate a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in average-gate-error over baseline stochastic-gradient-descent solutions and up to a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in gate time from optimal gate synthesis counterparts. These significant improvements in both fidelity and runtime are achieved by combining new physical understandings and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Our results open a venue for wider applications in quantum simulation, quantum chemistry and quantum supremacy tests using near-term quantum devices.},

  abstract = {Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation pro- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reacts these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as wellas researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or - chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.},

Our recursive two-step lookahead acquisition function for Bayesian optimization makes nonmyopic decisions at every stage by maximizing the expected utility at the specified time horizon. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step lookahead framework with a customizable {\textbackslash}emph\{value\} function that allows users to define the utility. We illustrate how lookahead versions of classic acquisition functions such as the expected improvement, probability of improvement, and upper confidence bound can be obtained with this framework. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach on several carefully constructed synthetic cases and a real-world quantum optimal control problem.},

Although these high numbers engender optimism that fault-tolerant quantum computing is within reach, the connection of average gate fidelity with fault-tolerance requirements is not direct. Here we use reported average gate fidelity to determine an upper bound on the quantum-gate error rate, which is the appropriate metric for assessing progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation, and we demonstrate that this bound is asymptotically tight for general noise. Although this bound is unlikely to be saturated by experimental noise, we demonstrate using explicit examples that the bound indicates a realistic deviation between the true error rate and the reported average fidelity. We introduce the Pauli distance as a measure of this deviation, and we show that knowledge of the Pauli distance enables tighter estimates of the error rate of quantum gates.},

In this paper, we show how this approach holds promise for adaptive measurement strategies to characterize present-day quantum technology platforms. In particular, we focus on arrays of coupled cavities and qubit arrays. Both represent model systems of high relevance for modern applications, like quantum simulations and computing, and both have been realized in platforms where measurement and control can be exploited to characterize and counteract unavoidable disorder.

Even for simple two-parameter estimation problems, the Bayesian approach yields higher accuracy and precision for the parameter estimates obtained. It requires less data, is more flexible in dealing with different model systems, can deal better with uncertainty in initial conditions and measurements, and enables adaptive refinement of the estimates. The comparison results show that this holds for measurements of large ensembles of spins and atoms limited by Gaussian noise as well as projection noise limited data from repeated single-shot measurements of a single quantum device.},

In a complementary proposal, colocated, auxiliary ``spectator'' qubits act as in situ probes of noise and enable real-time, coherent corrections of data qubit errors. We used an array of cesium spectator qubits to correct correlated phase errors on an array of rubidium data qubits. By combining in-sequence readout, data processing, and feedforward operations, these correlated errors were suppressed within the execution of the quantum circuit. The protocol is broadly applicable to quantum information platforms and establishes key tools for scaling neutral-atom quantum processors: mid-circuit readout of atom arrays, real-time processing and feedforward, and coherent mid-circuit reloading of atomic qubits.},

Here we present a closed-loop Bayesian learning algorithm for estimating multiple unknown parameters in a dynamical model, using optimized experimental ``probe'' controls and measurement. The estimation algorithm is based on a Bayesian particle filter, and is designed to autonomously choose informationally optimized probe experiments with which to compare to model predictions. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in both simulated calibration tasks and in an experimental single-qubit ion-trap system. Experimentally, we find that, with 60 times fewer samples, we exceed the precision of conventional calibration methods, delivering an approximately 93 times improvement in efficiency (as quantified by the reduction of measurements and resets required to achieve a target residual uncertainty and multiplied by the increase in accuracy). In simulated and experimental demonstrations, we see that successively longer pulses are selected as the posterior uncertainty iteratively decreases, leading to an exponential improvement in the accuracy of model parameters with the number of experimental queries, and a commensurate increase in the per-query time.},

QuRE is a layout estimation tool that estimates the cost of practical implementations of quantum circuits in a variety of competing physical quantum technologies and with a variety of strategies for fault tolerant encoding. For each specified algorithm, QuRE estimates quantities such as number of physical qubits, execution time, probability of success of the computation, and physical gate counts for elementary quantum gate types of a specified technology. Out of the box, QuRE supports estimation for six physical quantum technologies, seven quantum algorithms, and with error correction using the Steane [1], [2], Bacon-Shor [3], Knill [4] or surface [5], [6] error correction codes. Moreover, QuRE is extendable and can easily accommodate other choices. After describing QuRE, we use it to investigate the tradeoff between concatenated and surface error correction coding techniques, demonstrating the existence of a crossover point for the Ground State Estimation Algorithm [7].},

While the assumption that noise obeys Gaussian statistics is commonly employed, noise is generically non-Gaussian in nature. In particular, the Gaussian approximation breaks down whenever a qubit is strongly coupled to discrete noise sources or has a non-linear response to the environmental degrees of freedom. Thus, in order to both scrutinize the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and capture distinctive non-Gaussian signatures, a tool for characterizing non-Gaussian noise is essential. Here, we experimentally validate a quantum control protocol which, in addition to the spectrum, reconstructs the leading higher-order spectrum of engineered non-Gaussian dephasing noise using a superconducting qubit as a sensor. This first experimental demonstration of non-Gaussian noise spectroscopy represents a major step toward demonstrating a complete spectral estimation toolbox for quantum devices.},

In this note, we revisit their coupling and autoregressive transformation layers as probabilistic graphical models and show that they reduce to Bayesian networks with a pre-defined topology and a learnable density at each node. From this new perspective, we provide three results. First, we show that stacking multiple transformations in a normalizing flow relaxes independence assumptions and entangles the model distribution. Second, we show that a fundamental leap of capacity emerges when the depth of affine flows exceeds 3 transformation layers. Third, we prove the non-universality of the affine normalizing flow, regardless of its depth.},

For weakly anharmonic systems, such as superconducting transmon qubits, short gates lead to leakage to states outside of the computational subspace. Control pulses designed with open-loop optimal control may reduce such leakage. However, model inaccuracies can severely limit the usability of such pulses. We implemented a closed-loop optimization that simultaneously adapts all control parameters based on measurements of a cost function built from Clifford gates. We directly optimize the amplitude and phase of each sample point of the digitized control pulse. We thereby fully exploit the capabilities of the pulse generation electronics and create a 4.16\,ns single-qubit pulse with 99.76\,\% fidelity and 0.044\,\% leakage. This is a sevenfold reduction of the leakage rate and a threefold reduction in standard errors of the best DRAG pulse we have calibrated at such short durations on the same system.},

However, given the current technological limitations, such as fabrication imperfections and environmental noise, this is not always possible. To address these issues, a great deal of theoretical and numerical methods for quantum system identification and control have been developed. These methods range from traditional curve fittings, which are limited by the accuracy of the model that describes the system, to machine learning (ML) methods, which provide efficient control solutions but no control beyond the output of the model, nor insights into the underlying physical process. Here we experimentally demonstrate a `graybox' approach to construct a physical model of a quantum system and use it to design optimal control. We report superior performance over model fitting, while generating unitaries and Hamiltonians, which are quantities not available from the structure of standard supervised ML models. Our approach combines physics principles with high-accuracy ML and is effective with any problem where the required controlled quantities cannot be directly measured in experiments. This method naturally extends to time-dependent and open quantum systems, with applications in quantum noise spectroscopy and cancellation.},

In this paper, we address the problems of practically modeling and controlling an integrated optical waveguide array chip---a technology expected to have many applications in telecommunications and optical quantum information processing. This photonic circuit can be electrically reconfigured, but only the output optical signal can be monitored. As a result, the conventional control methods cannot be naively applied. Characterizing such a chip is challenging for three reasons. First, there are uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonian model describing the chip. Second, we expect distortions of the control voltages caused by the chip's electrical response, which cannot be directly observed. And third, there are imperfections in the measurements caused by losses from coupling the chip externally to optical fibers. We have developed a deep neural network (NN) approach to solve these problems. The architecture is designed specifically to overcome the aforementioned challenges using a gated recurrent unit -based network as the central component. The Hamiltonian is estimated as a blackbox, while the rules of quantum mechanics such as state evolution is embedded in the structure as a whitebox. The resulting overall graybox model of the chip shows good performance both quantitatively in terms of the mean square error and qualitatively in terms of the shape of the predicted waveforms We use this NN to solve a classical and a quantum control problem. In the classical application we find a control sequence to approximately realize a time-dependent output power distribution. For the quantum application we obtain the control voltages to realize a target set of quantum gates. The method we propose is generic and can be applied to other systems that can only be probed indirectly.},

SMC allows for probabilistic evaluation of properties of interest, such as a certain parameter's time to failure. We extend the SMC for Processor Analysis (SPA) framework, which uses SMC for evaluation of classical systems, to create SPA for Quantum calibration (SPAQ) enabling simplified tuning and analysis of quantum system calibration. We focus on a directed acyclic graph-based calibration optimization scheme and demonstrate how to craft properties of interest for its analysis. We show how to use SPAQ to find lower bounds of time to failure information, hidden node dependencies, and parameter threshold values and use that information to improve simulated quantum system availability through calibration scheme adjustments.},

In this tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers.

We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers.
